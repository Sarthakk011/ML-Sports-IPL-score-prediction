 IPL Score Prediction with Machine Learning:

 1.Data Collection:
   - Gather historical IPL match data, including team performance, player statistics, venue details, and match outcomes.

 2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
   - Create features such as team strengths, player averages, and venue conditions.

3. Feature Selection:
   - Choose relevant features based on their impact on the target variable (score).
   - Use techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis.

 4. Model Selection:
   - Select a regression model suitable for predicting numerical values. Common choices include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

 5. Training the Model:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the selected model using the training dataset.

 6. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

 7. Prediction:
   - Use the trained model to predict scores for upcoming IPL matches.


Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model selection, training, and evaluation.
